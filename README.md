# Database Systems Internals: Query Optimization Project

This repository contains a multi-part project for **TCSS 564: Database Systems Internals**, focusing on the principles and performance of database query optimization.

## Project Overview

This project explores the internal workings of database management systems, specifically how different query plans are generated, evaluated, and optimized. The work is documented in a series of comprehensive reports, which detail the analysis, implementation, and evaluation of query optimization techniques.

The primary goal is to investigate how factors like join ordering, indexing, and data statistics impact query performance and to analyze the cost-based decisions made by a database optimizer.

## Project Reports

This repository archives the three main deliverables for the project:

* **[TCSS564_Project_Part1_Kannika Armstrong.pdf](TCSS564_Project_Part1_Kannika%20Armstrong.pdf)**
    * Part 1: Initial analysis of query plans and cost estimation.
* **[TCSS564_Project_Part2_Kannika Armstrong.pdf](TCSS564_Project_Part2_Kannika%20Armstrong.pdf)**
    * Part 2: Implementation or simulation of optimization strategies.
* **[TCSS564_Project_Part3_Kannika Armstrong.pdf](TCSS564_Project_Part3_Kannika%20Armstrong.pdf)**
    * Part 3: Final performance evaluation, benchmarking, and conclusion.

## Key Concepts & Topics

The research and analysis documented in these reports cover topics such as:

* Query Planning and Parsing
* Cost-Based Optimization
* Join Algorithms (e.g., Nested Loop, Hash Join, Merge Join)
* Index Utilization
* Selectivity and Cardinality Estimation
* Relational Algebra
* Performance Benchmarking
